# weather-app
Created a responsive weather web app using HTML, CSS and Javascript to view weather of 5 days of any city.
Weather data sourced from "https://openweathermap.org/api". 

Added search functionality (by city name). Cities can be marked as favourite and are added to browser local storage.

Project hosted using Firebase on: https://weather-app-dib.web.app/
